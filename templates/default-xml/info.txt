Summary: Raw XML output XML-Template theme for the Serendipity Styx Blog system
Description: Simple theme from 2006, newly refurbished to work with Serendipity Styx Edition. This theme outputs raw XML on the frontside, to make the content readable by XML-Readers.
It does still effect some minor plugin integrations on the backend side, like linktrimmer or amazonchooser, and is more or less meant to be used in a non-too-much-extended core release blog, though it does works with some well known plugin apps, like staticpages, freetags etc.
