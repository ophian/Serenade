$info['theme_info_summary'] = 'A "Bootstrap 4.6.0" based HTML5 Framework Template, based on fallback engine "Bootstrap4".';

$info['theme_info_desc'] = 'This theme has not only updated to latest bootstrap assets, it also simplified the config and the index file grid for moving the sidebars to bottom.
On the other hand it extended the main template files and added an easy auto-"handmade" support for navigation bar submenues.
Apart from direct or copy theme usage, this allows to be used as a good middle-layer-engine for possible simple GRAND-child themes by "Engine: b46, bootstrap4", just by adding some additional user styles and probably changing the index files structural grid.';
