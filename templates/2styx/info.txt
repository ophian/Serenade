Summary: The Styx Backend testing Theme

Description:
<u>Please Note&colon;</u> This theme has no existing frontend!<br>
This example backend theme relegates to the Serendipity core backend templates in the "2k11/admin" subdirectory.
As an example it proves the ability that you can simply add a more or less empty backend theme, which uses the fallback to the default "2k11" backend template files.
With this in mind you are able to just change and add those files only, which are necessary to fill your needs.

This example may change in future to hold some real files for the backend generation.<br><br>
THE FOLLOWING IS THE DESCRIPTION OF THE RELEGATED BACKEND&colon;<br>
The template files in that directory build and create the look of the complete admin interface.
They also contain some workflow and logic, as well as the javascript libraries.
If you want to use your own backend theme, copy the "admin" directory to a theme.
In there, change the "info.txt" file to add a "Backend&colon; Yes" line and select the new backend theme in the newly loaded theme list.
From now on, you can edit the files and styles of own backend theme and adapt it to your extending needs.<br>
<u><b>Please Note&colon;</b></u> This only is recommended for highly experienced users and completely off the update track!
