This directory contained the pre Serendipity 2.0 fallback admin templates.

Most files here were set deprecated since Serendipity 2.0 and now removed with Serendipity Styx 2.1.

Since Serendipity 2.0, the default backend theme is "2k11", which holds the current administration and fallback template files for all common backend cases.

The files still left in here are special cased template files and images which are required for the backend.

Some of the old and likewise removed admin images may still be called by some older not very often used plugins. If you catch one of these, please tell us to update by time. Thanks.
