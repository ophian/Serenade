$info['theme_info_summary'] = 'The Styx default template. Previously named Serendipity v2.3 (w/o relation to core version number).';

$info['theme_info_desc'] = 'New revisited for Styx 2.1 to make it fully responsive (3-2-1),
without changing much of the "old school" html. Works additionally as a full styled fallback
for the PHP and XML Engine and as a file fallback pool for several other themes.
This theme previously wasn\'t meant to be a theme out of hundrets.
Since "bulletproof" and later on "2k11" became the Serendipity <b>standard</b> template(s),
this theme was used as a backup and error fallback theme, when something was searched for compile
and not in your usual theme or the fallback theme cascade. It also is chosen
if no engine and no style is set, like for the default-php and/or default-xml themes.';
