Require Serendipity: 1.7
Engine: default

Summary: Advanced option theme in optional 3, 2, or 1 -column layouts with various sidebar combinations.

Description: This theme - for long years - was the Serendipity Standard theme since Serendipity v. 1.2.
It allows to set 4 different colorsets and uses various user options to differently disable or set/move certain parts of the frontend, like footers or forms, without touching code by hand.
Among these it was used as the default backend theme for a long time. This latter is no longer usable since Serendipity 2.0.
2017-04-19 - Removed dead cocomment option and scripting.
