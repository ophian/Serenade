Summary: Default PHP-Template Responsive HTML5 Theme for the Serendipity Styx Blog system

Description: Simple theme based on the old default theme from 2006, newly refurbished to work with Serendipity Styx Edition. May still miss some template files converted to PHP.
Read the themes IMPORTANT-TODO file for more.<br>

<u><b>Please note&colon;</b></u><br>
The less (Smarty extending) plugins used - the more will this work without errors.<br>

Currently there is one notable restriction!<br>
The GLOBALS superarray for the backend entries <u>preview_iframe</u> does not work, and nothing is parsed and returned by content.
So you may edit old entries as ever or save new entries ONCE. Don't use the returned form again without a new page request!
If you just entered a NEW ENTRY and your preview iframe is an empty blue field, go somewhere else in the backend and return,
since a completely new created entry relies on its ID passed back to core by the iframe.
