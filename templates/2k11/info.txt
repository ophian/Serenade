Summary: The Serendipity Backend/Frontend Standard Theme

Description:
This theme defines the current standard, defined and used by the core Serendipity blog system.
Regarding Serendipitys infinite possibilities, it is the currently best-concatenated and interlocked theme,
covering most of them as simple as possible in a wide frame, made easy to look through.

Backenddesc:
This theme accommodates the Serendipity core backend templates in the "2k11/admin" subdirectory.
The template files in that directory build and create the look of the complete admin interface.
They also contain some workflow and logic, as well as the javascript libraries.
If you want to use your own backend theme, copy the "admin" directory to a theme.
In there, change the "info.txt" file to add a "Backend&colon; Yes" line and select the new backend theme in the newly loaded theme list.
From now on, you can edit the files and styles of own backend theme and adapt it to your extending needs.<br>
<u><b>Please Note&colon;</b></u> This only is recommended for highly experienced users and completely off the update track!
