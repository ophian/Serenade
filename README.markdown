# Serendipity - a PHP Weblog/Blog software

[Serendipity](http://s9y.org) is a PHP-powered weblog application which gives the user an easy way to maintain an online diary, weblog or even a complete homepage. While the default package is designed for the casual blogger, Serendipity offers a flexible, expandable and easy-to-use framework with the power for professional applications.

#### Why Styx?
Its project name originates from "_River Styx_" in Greek classical mythology. Make your mind why this was chosen.

_Serendipity 2.1-Alpha ++_ more and more became a broken playground, simplifying things without need and commits without knowledge and appreciation about its deepest nuances. Which I regret deeply. 
Styx is what Serendipity should be!
