# Serendipity Styx - A reliable, secure & extensible PHP blog

[Serendipity](https://s9y.org) is a PHP-powered weblog engine which gives the user an easy way to maintain a blog. While the default package is designed for the casual blogger, Serendipity offers an expandable framework with the power for professional applications.

### Why Styx?
Its project name originally originates from *"River Styx"* in Greek classical mythology. Make your mind why this was chosen.
If this is too dark for you, you may read this as **S**erendipi**ty** Ne**x**t. :) or just **Sty x**.

*Serendipity 2.1-Alpha ++* more and more became a broken playground, simplifying things without need and commits without knowledge and appreciation about its deepest nuances. Which I regret deeply.

**Styx** is what **Serendipity** should be!

After many years of heavy development, in special for the 1.7, 2.0 and 2.1 Series, and long years of continuously help in the community I came to the conclusion to stop my contributes for a while - "finish" the draft of the [2.1 HTML book][1] - present it as a birthday and farewell present to the Serendipians - in Spring 2016 - saw where the next S9y-Camp headed to - and realised that my expertise and insight wasn't really wanted any more. Some long month later I decided to go. Now - *21st of September* - it is done. **Alea iacta est!**

### The Serendipity Styx Edition

It was built in my origin intent primarily for myself to keep track on my vision of what Serendipity used to be, wide and open, and with multi levels of extended properties. I wanted it to not cut off this extendibility without real need. It is a contributed document of my deep affinity with Serendipity.

As long as I find the time and the commitment to make this even better, Styx will develop and will include all good parts of the origin Serendipity development. You may replace your origin Serendipity installation without any fear with this extended Edition and you will find everything work as intendet. Go and read the **Styx** [release notes][2] to see how this can be easily done without too much effort. Even more you may want to read the [commit history][3] and/or the **Styx** [ChangeLog][4].

Since **plugins** are an essential part of Serendipity, this repository holds a strongly maintained additional_plugins repository. The Styx Spartacus is able to work with it - Serendipity is not. An update history "Log Page" will probably need an own html webpage to start with or be able to provide a web Spartacus downloader. This is done laterly, if ever.
